;;; Pressure is defined as the force per unit area.  In this context,
;;; that means the total momentum per unit time transferred to the walls
;;; by particle hits, divided by the surface area of the walls.  (Here
;;; we're in a two dimensional world, so the "surface area" of the walls
;;; is just their delta.)  Each wall contributes a different amount
;;; to the total pressure in the box, based on the number of collisions, the
;;; direction of each collision, and the delta of the wall.  Conservation of momentum
;;; in hits ensures that the difference in momentum for the particles is equal to and
;;; opposite to that for the wall.  The force on each wall is the rate of change in
;;; momentum imparted to the wall, or the sum of change in momentum for each particle:
;;; F = SUM  [d(mv)/dt] = SUM [m(dv/dt)] = SUM [ ma ], in a direction perpendicular to
;;; the wall surface.  The pressure (P) on a given wall is the force (F) applied to that

  ;; Here we impose a rule that collisions only take place when there
  ;; are exactly two particles per patch.  We do this because when the
  ;; student introduces new particles from the side, we want them to
  ;; form a uniform wavefront.
  ;;
  ;; Why do we want a uniform wavefront?  Because it is actually more
  ;; realistic.  (And also because the curriculum uses the uniform
  ;; wavefront to help teach the relationship between particle collisions,
  ;; wall hits, and pressure.)
  ;;
  ;; Why is it realistic to assume a uniform wavefront?  Because in reality,
  ;; whether a collision takes place would depend on the actual headings
  ;; of the particles, not merely on their proximity.  Since the particles
  ;; in the wavefront have identical speeds and near-identical headings,
  ;; in reality they would not collide.  So even though the two-particles
  ;; rule is not itself realistic, it produces a realistic result.  Also,
  ;; unless the number of particles is extremely large, it is very rare
  ;; for three or more particles to land on the same patch (for example,
  ;; with 400 particles it happens less than 1% of the time).  So imposing
  ;; this additional rule should have only a negligible effect on the
  ;; aggregate behavior of the system.
  ;;
  ;; Why does this rule produce a uniform wavefront?  The particles all
  ;; start out on the same patch, which means that without the only-two
  ;; rule, they would all start colliding with each other immediately,
  ;; resulting in much random variation of speeds and headings.  With
  ;; the only-two rule, they are prevented from colliding with each other
  ;; until they have spread out a lot.  (And in fact, if you observe
  ;; the wavefront closely, you will see that it is not completely smooth,
  ;; because some collisions eventually do start occurring when it thins out while fanning.)

;; THIS IS THE HEART OF THE PARTICLE SIMULATION, AND YOU ARE STRONGLY ADVISED
;; NOT TO CHANGE IT UNLESS YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE DOING!
;;
;; The two particles colliding are self and other-particle, and while the
;; collision is performed from the point of view of self, both particles are
;; modified to reflect its effects. This is somewhat complicated, so I'll
;; give a general outline here:
;;   1. Do initial setup, and determine the heading between particle centers
;;      (call it theta).
;;   2. Convert the representation of the velocity of each particle from
;;      speed/heading to a theta-based vector whose first component is the
;;      particle's speed along theta, and whose second component is the speed
;;      perpendicular to theta.
;;   3. Modify the velocity vectors to reflect the effects of the collision.
;;      This involves:
;;        a. computing the velocity of the center of mass of the whole system
;;           along direction theta
;;        b. updating the along-theta components of the two velocity vectors.
;;   4. Convert from the theta-based vector representation of velocity back to
;;      the usual speed/heading representation for each particle.
;;   5. Perform final cleanup and update derived quantities.

## WHAT IS IT?

This model explores the relationship between the volume of a gas container and the pressure of a gas in that container.  This model is part of the "Connected Chemistry" curriculum http://ccl.northwestern.edu/curriculum/ConnectedChemistry/ which explore the behavior of gases.

Most of the models in the Connected Chemistry curriculum use the same basic rules for simulating the behavior of gases.  Each model highlights different features of how gas behavior is related to gas particle behavior.

In all of the models, gas particles are assumed to move and to collide, both with each other and with objects such as walls.

In this model, the gas container has an adjustable volume.  The number of particles can also be changed.  Temperature is held constant throughout the model.  In this model, students can also look at the relationship between the number of particles and pressure, as well as the volume of the gas container and pressure.  Alternatively, they can change both the number of particles and the volume of the gas container, and see how these combined changes affect pressure.  These models have been adapted from the model GasLab Pressure Box.

## HOW IT WORKS

Particles are modeled as perfectly elastic with no energy except their kinetic energy, due to their motion.  Collisions between particles are elastic.  Particles can be color-coded by speed with the SHOW-SPEED-AS-COLOR? chooser.  For example, selecting red-green-blue makes colors slow particles in blue, medium-speed particles in green, and fast particles in red.

The exact way two particles collide is as follows:
1. Two turtles "collide" when they find themselves on the same patch.
2. A random axis is chosen, as if they are two balls that hit each other and this axis is the line connecting their centers.
3. They exchange momentum and energy along that axis, according to the conservation of momentum and energy.  This calculation is done in the center of mass system.
4. Each turtle is assigned its new velocity, energy, and heading.
5. If a turtle finds itself on or very close to a wall of the container, it "bounces," reflecting its direction but keeping its speed.

## HOW TO USE IT

Buttons:
SETUP - sets up the initial conditions set on the sliders.
GO/STOP - runs and stops the model.
MOVE WALL - allows the user to move the orange wall to the right of its current location (so as to permit adiabatic free expansion of the gas), by clicking with the mouse in the view.  If the model is currently running (i.e., if GO/STOP is depressed), clicking on MOVE WALL will stop it.  To continue running the model after moving the wall, press GO/STOP again.

Sliders:
NUMBER - sets the number of gas particles in the box when the simulation starts.
INITIAL-WALL-POSITION helps adjust the initial volume by setting the location of the orange box wall.

Switches:
LABELS? turn particle id labels on or off

Choosers:
SHOW-SPEED-AS-COLOR? allows you to visualize particle speed using a color palette.
- The "blue-green-red" setting shows the lower half of the speeds of the starting population as blue, and the upper half as red.
- The "violet shades" setting shows a gradient from dark violet (slow) to light violet (fast).
- The "all green" setting shows all particles in green, regardless of speed.
- The "custom color" setting, referenced in the Pedagogica version of this model, allows the user to modify the color of one or more particles, without having to worry that the particles will be recolored with each tick of the clock (as is the case for the other color options).

Monitors:
CLOCK - number of clock cycles that GO has run.
VOLUME - the volume of the box.
    Volume is computed based on what it would be using the 3D view.  The can be visualized as the inner gas volume (yellow walls and orange wall) that is 1 patch width deep in the z direction.

PRESSURE - the total pressure in the box.
WALL HITS PER PARTICLE - the average number of wall hits in one clock tick

Plots:
- VOLUME VS. TIME: plots the volume of the gas container over time.  Volume is computed based on what it would be using the 3D view.  The can be visualized as the inner gas volume (yellow walls and orange wall) that is 1 patch width deep in the z direction.
- PRESSURE VS. TIME: plots the average gas pressure inside of the box over time.

1. Adjust the INITIAL-NUMBER and/or the INITIAL-WALL-POSITION slider.
2. Press the SETUP button
3. Press GO/STOP and observe what happens.
4. Press MOVE WALL.  The particle motion will pause momentarily.
5. Then move your cursor to a spot inside the WORLD & VIEW, to the right of the current position of the orange wall.  Click on this spot and the wall will move and the particle motion will resume.
6. Observe the relationship between the Volume vs. Time graph and Pressure vs. Time graph.

## THINGS TO NOTICE

When you move the wall, the faster particles move toward it first.  Does this type of diffusion occur in reality?

There are combinations of NUMBER of particles and volumes for the container that yield the same pressure.  What do you notice about the density of the gas particles in these situations:  e.g. double the number of particles and double the volume?

## THINGS TO TRY

Find a mathematical model that related volume to pressure by recording and graphing various volume and pressure values in the model.

What combination of volume and number of particles gives the highest pressure?

## EXTENDING THE MODEL

Add an external force on the orange wall and a mass for the wall.  Allow it to move related to the forces that are on it from particle hits and the external force.

Model two gas chambers side both filled with gases side by side, with a movable wall in between.

Add a heated/cooled wall on the left side of the model.  If you combine this with an external force on the orange wall, what happens to the motion of the wall if you alternatively heat and cool the left wall?
